# AlgorithmicComposition
A patch designed to trigger an algorithmically generated piece of music.

If you’re a Supercollider user you should be able to download the whole folder and simply follow the instructions in the “OpenThisFile.rtf”. The idea was to write a self contained patch with a simple GUI that would allow a certain degree of control over a randomised piece of music. This patch uses a nice mix of synthesis and audio processes and also includes an ATS spectral buffer. 

Note: All under lying code is sub patched for user experience. Once the user has changed the relevant file directories up on first use, the user can simply evaluate a single load path function which will bring up the GUI.
